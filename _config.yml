  👋 Hi, I'm <strong>Srinath Tummala</strong> — an <strong>AI Engineer & Data Scientist</strong> with 4 years of experience specialising in production-ready <strong>Generative AI, LLMs, and RAG pipelines</strong>.
  
  I have a proven track record of delivering high-scale AI microservices for leading technology firms, including pivotal work for <strong>UAE-headquartered Onpassive</strong>. My expertise in performance engineering has resulted in an <strong>80% reduction in model training time</strong> and a <strong>60% reduction in response latency</strong>.
  

  <br>
  <strong>Core Expertise:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Production GenAI:</strong> Architecting enterprise RAG pipelines using LangChain, FAISS, and GPT-4.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance Engineering:</strong> Optimising high-dimensional models using Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI).</li>
    <li><strong>Scalable Deployment:</strong> Building robust FastAPI microservices containerised with Docker and deployed via AWS.</li>
  </ul>

  I blend deep technical rigour with a production-first mindset, from engineering multilingual NLP systems to deploying eKYC modules to international standards. 
  
  Let's build smarter, scalable solutions together! 🚀📊🤖
