### Malicious URL Detection

### Project Overview:
● Detection of malicious URLs and classifying them as malicious and benign using various
machine learning classifiers. Several feature extraction methods such as lexical features
and host-based features are extracted better improve the performance of the classifiers.
Primary objective:
● To build a binary classification model for the detection and classification of malicious and
benign URLs by improving the accuracy and processing time.
Secondary objectives:
1. Understanding the characteristics of spam and ham URLs.
2. To build a Machine Learning model to classify spam and ham URLs.
3. To select the best-suited feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms for
detection and classifying the malicious URLs and devise an improved method.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Case Study - EDA on Lending Club Data Set

### Project Overview:
● This case study is based on Lending Club Dataset. Based on the available data set, we are required to draw insights that help in categorizing a new customer. The objective of this case study is to analyze the data to identify customers who might default on the loan.
