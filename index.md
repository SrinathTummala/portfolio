### Project Overview:
● Detection of malicious URLs and classifying them as malicious and benign using various
machine learning classifiers. Several feature extraction methods such as lexical features
and host-based features are extracted better improve the performance of the classifiers.

Primary objective:

● To build a binary classification model for the detection and classification of malicious and
benign URLs by improving the accuracy and processing time.

Secondary objectives:
● Understanding the characteristics of spam and ham URLs.

● To build a Machine Learning model to classify spam and ham URLs.

● To select the best-suited feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms for
detection and classifying the malicious URLs and devise an improved method.
